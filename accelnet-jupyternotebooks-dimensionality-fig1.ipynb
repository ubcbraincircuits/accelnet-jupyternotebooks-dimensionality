The correlation dimension and participation ratio quanitfy the dimensionality of such complex and dynamic systems locally and globally as can be observed by the executing the script below.\n",

The shape of the graph shows that the participation ratio remains an accurate representation of the dimensionality of the system as we look at larger scales. The participation ratio counts the effective dimensions of the spread of data by taking the ratio of the square of the first and second moments of the eigenvalue probability density function. The number of effective dimensions interpolates to the participation ratio globally; it intuitively makes sense in dynamic systems such as the Lorenz attractor (which is what we perform our analysis on in our execution of the code segment below). Therefore, we can use this value to increase our understanding of the dimensionality of complex neural systems."
